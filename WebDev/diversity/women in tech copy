Women in Technology is a commercial organisation committed to assisting suitably qualified and experienced women in their search for career opportunities in information technology.  We are a stand-alone division of McGregor Boyall Associates, a leading UK recruitment consultancy with a twenty-five year track record of delivering recruitment and resourcing solutions to a wide range of national and international clients.

Women in Technology comprises a job board that is dedicated to advertising positions (either directly or via the Women in Technology recruitment team) within organisations that have an explicit commitment to increasing the number of female technologists working for them by placing diversity at the heart of recruitment and retention.

We believe unequivocally that a genuinely diverse talent base within an organisation constitutes a strong and sustainable corporate asset.  Women in Technologyâ€™s strategic goal is to support that belief with practical, effective and commercially self-sustaining action.
