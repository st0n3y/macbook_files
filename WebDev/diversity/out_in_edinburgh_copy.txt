Run monthly, we bring an opportunity to gather in an informal professional environment to meet, talk and discuss a wide range of topics.
We explore what it is like being LGBTI in various different industries, in life and open up wider conversations and discussions.

To date we’ve tackled LGBTI parenting, the importance of Allies, the Glass Ceiling and Glass Stiletto, Politics, LGBTI Refugees, Schools, Sport and even snuck in the occasional pub quiz!

We look at the role each of us can play as individuals and organisations in supporting your local LGBTI communities and charities, and provide opportunities for practical involvement for you and your organisation.

We provide a great opportunity to network with likeminded professionals and individuals from different walks of life. It’s a great opportunity to get some hints and tips you can take home for both your professional and your personal lives.
