IntoWork is a specialised employment support service for disabled jobseekers across Edinburgh, East and Midlothian.

We use the 5 stage Supported Employment Model to help people with a disability or long-term health condition reach their employment goals. We have particular specialisms in Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and Mental Health.

We work closely with local employers offering advice, guidance, training and on-going support to both employer and employee alike.
